# Coding Challenges

The purpose of this project is to have an area to store all of the typical interview coding excerises.

## Description

Most people *hate* these projects. However, I think that but being able to complete a simple 
coding excerise you are showing your knowledge and understanding of algorithms and how to code in general.
This is just my single opinion though.
