 # Coding Challenges ðŸŽ¨

The purpose of this project is to have an area to store all of the typical interview coding exercises that I have completed

## Description

I think that but being able to complete a simple coding exercise you are showing your knowledge and understanding of algorithms and how to code in general.
This is just my single opinion though.
